# TUF Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is a dynamic one-page website built with React. It includes a banner with a controllable visibility feature and a countdown timer. An internal dashboard allows you to manage the banner's content, visibility, timer, and clickable link. The backend is integrated with a MySQL database to store and manage the banner data.

##Important Points:

- **This code is for Backend, If you want to see the code of the frontend then go to another repository- [https://github.com/alk-alok/frontend-tuf-task](https://github.com/alk-alok/frontend-tuf-task)**
